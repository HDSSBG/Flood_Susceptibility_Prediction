In this repository, we have tried to develop a scalable flood susceptibility model using machine learning algorithms.

ML Algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Dagging Classification

Input Parameters: Rainfall, LULC, Distance to the nearest stream, Soil Type, Elevation, Slope, Aspect, Total Curvature, ...
                  Terrain Roughness Index, Topographic Wetness Index, Stream Power Index, Sediment Trasportation Index
